== Problem description (Analysis)
The following project consists of a concurrent and distributed server that allows users to request the prime factorization or goldbach sums of any given number, through two separate applications. Both of these are integrated into the server, but are not yet implemented as independent processes or threads (a task for future versions). This project involves both task concurrency and data parallelism, as well as a basic approach to networks.

The following lines summarize the fundamentals of prime factorization and Goldbach’s conjecture for a better understanding of the program’s use.

=== Prime Factorization
Positive whole numbers, excluding the first one (1), can be divided into two main groups: prime numbers and composite numbers. The former group consists of numbers only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5), while the latter encapsulates numbers with more than two divisors (e.g. 4, which is divisible by 2) and can be broken down into prime factors. For instance, the prime factorization of 72 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, which can also be expressed as 2^3 * 3^2, where ^ precedes an exponent. The following figure shows the process of calculating the factors.

=== Goldbach’s Conjecture
This conjecture establishes that every integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of prime numbers. It is commonly divided into two separate conjectures:

- *Strong Goldbach conjecture*: every even number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of two primes. For example, 6 can be split into 3 + 3, 18 into 7 + 11 or 5 + 13, 28 into 11 + 17 or 13 + 15, etc.

- *Weak Goldbach conjecture*: all odd integers greater than 5 are the sum of three primes. For instance, 7 is the sum of 2 + 2 + 3, 9 into 3 + 3 + 3 or 2 + 2 + 5, and others.

The strong conjecture remains unproven, whereas the weak form is widely regarded as true by most mathematicians, at least for sufficiently large integers. The following figure visualizes the strong conjecture, where colored lines for prime numbers intersect (unfilled circles) to form distinct even numbers.
