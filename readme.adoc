|1 |link:web_server/readme.adoc[Web server] |The purpose of this project is to create a distributed, concurrent web server that provides concurrent service for different web applications, such as Goldbach summation and prime factorization calculators, running in parallel. This project addresses task concurrency and data parallelism, as well as a basic approach to networking.

|2 |link:nbody/readme.adoc[N Body] |Simulation of a classic problem in physics and astronomy that involves predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. The project implements a distributed simulation using MPI to handle the computational complexity of simulating large number of bodies.
